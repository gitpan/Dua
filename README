Perl5 DUA Extension Module 

This module is based heavily on Eric Douglas' duaperl version 1.0a3,
and is basically a conversion of the duaperl.mus file to the XS form.

I tried very hard not modify any of Eric's code, in order to keep things
as portable as possible. The only change I had to make was to dualib/dua.h
to #define fatal as croak to work with Perl 5.

I added two additional subroutines, the first duainit is not exported but
is called by the Dua modules bootstrap to initialise a few things. The
second is dua_errstr which returns the current error string. I did this
as I couldn't work out how to access a constant located in the C code from
Perl.

I may in the future created an Object Oriented module, but that would
probably require some major changes to dua.c in order to accomodate
multiple instances of the class.

INSTALLATION

i) You'll need to modify the LIBS section Makefile.PL to point to your
   LDAP libraries.

ii) You'll also need to modify dualib/Makefile to point to your PERL directory
    & you LDAP include files. (Note: The perl directory is required as dua.c
    includes perl.h - Although it doesn't require this to compile I didn't
    remove the line to avoid any modifications to the original code.)

iii)
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install
