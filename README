Perl5 DUA Extension Module 

This module is based heavily on Eric Douglas' duaperl version 1.0a3,
and is basically a conversion of the duaperl.mus file to the XS form.

Unlike version 1.x of the module this implementation required some changes
to Eric's code, in order to allow multiple instances of the class. Basically
I bundled all the global data structures into one structure 'ldap_session_t'
which is passed to the dua functions.

I also modified dua_delattr function/method to allow attributes to be deleted
from an entry, it's a little crude as it deletes the attribute completely
rather than allowing selective removal of values.

There isn't a 'make test' as it was too difficult to come up with a suitable
set of tests. There are a couple of examples in the example directory
illustrating the basic use of the module.

INSTALLATION

i) You'll need to modify the LIBS section Makefile.PL to point to your
   LDAP libraries.

ii) You'll also need to modify dualib/Makefile to point to your PERL directory
    & you LDAP include files. (Note: The perl directory is required as dua.c
    includes perl.h)

iii)
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install
